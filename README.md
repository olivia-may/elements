# Elements

Elements modpack improved and reverse engineered from the server called
Tunneler's Abyss. Tunneler's Abyss's elements mod is closed source and
unfortunately can't be used anywhere else. This modpack tries to fix that
problem. It's open source and licensed under the AGPL so anyone that uses it
on a server has to share the source code, preventing this problem from
happening again.

## Aspirin

Aspirin pills mod. You can use aspirin to instantly heal health. Meant to be
used with mods that add a hunger bar. This mod can be used by itself.
